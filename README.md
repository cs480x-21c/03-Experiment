===


GitHub Details
---
## Design Achievements
- Used a background image which has the color really fits with the
color of the div where the charts are in. Makes it comfortable for
users to read the page.
- Used LucidChart to add the four charts near our error analysis
graph so that the analyzers can have a clear sense about what
chart the analysis lines are corresponding to.
- Besides the three visualizations as required, we added another
visualization for the experiment. The bar charts have both a vertical
and a horizontal direction, which can test the users' feeling
about bar charts in a more broad way.

## Technical Achievements
- Used Node.js to create the server.
- Made the email-sending functionality work so that the developers
can receive the responders' answers.
- Deployed the web page on herokuApp.
