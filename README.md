**Chart selection / Hypothesis**

Our first hypothesis/test was between the bar chart and the gradient bar chart. We, as the experiment scientists were curious as to how the gradient may effect estimation, for example maybe users could identify what shade of gray looks like 50%...etc. We didn't really have a basis for this one, we were curious. 

Our second hypothesis/test was between the bar chart and the circle chart. The circle chart tests area compared to the bar chart which tests how humans are perceiving length. We guessed that our subjects would be better at estimating length (bar chart)


**Experimental results / stats calculations**
 
 The results of the experiments were as follows:

**Design achievements**
 - Prompts given to the user were dependant on the graph selected
 - Responsive page design

**Tech Achievements**
 - Implemented a server/hosted backend that allowed each participant to add their results as they were filling it out
 - Implemented a live stats update vis where we could update as more results came in
 - Handcoded the 95% confident bootstrap algorithm in js so that we could do this
 - 



   
- Produce a README with figures that shows the visualizations you tested and results, ordered by best performance to worst performance. Follow the modern Cleveland-McGill figure below -- though note that using names instead of icons is fine.
- To obtain the ranking, calculate and report the average log2Error for each visualization across all trials and participants. This should be straightforward to do in a spreadsheet.
- Use Bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals for your error upper and lower bounds. Include these in your figures. Bootstrapped confidence intervals are easily implemented in R + ggplot2 using the `stat_summary` geom. You can also use Excel, Python, or many many other tools. Bootstrapped 95% CIs are **very** useful in modern experiment practice.
- Include example images of each visualization as they appeared in your experiment (i.e. if you used a pie chart show the actual pie chart you used in the experiment along with the markings, not an example from Google Images).
