	  <h1>Experiment</h1>
	  <p>The following is an experiment conducted by Yonatan Weiner, Parker Coady, and Errica Cheng for Project 3 of CS480X.</p>
	  <p></p>
	  <p>On each page will be a procedurally-generated graph. Your task is to guess the whole-number percentage of the smaller datapoint to the larger datapoint. For instance, if the smaller datapoint is 1 and the larger is 4, you would be guessing around 25.</p>
	  <p>There will be 20 bar graphs, 20 Sankey graphs, and 20 bubble charts.</p>
