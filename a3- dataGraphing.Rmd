## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
#Import the ggplot library

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(RCurl)
```

#Get the data from the cars-sample csv file

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Adria/OneDrive/Documents/R files")
cars <- read.csv("cars-sample.csv")
```

#Make the scatterplot, and be sure to decorate it :)

```{r}
d <- ggplot(cars, aes(Cylinders, MPG)) + geom_point()
d + stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", colour = "red", size = 1) + stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", size = 0.5, colour = "red") + coord_flip()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
