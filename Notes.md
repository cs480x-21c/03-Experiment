# The viz
  - Bar chart
  - Pie chart
  - Stacked bar chart

# Our hypothesis:
We predict that the ranking of effectiveness in human perception of data will be the most effective in the bar chart, followed by the stacked bar chart and pie chart respectively. Users will be able to more accurately compare two given data structures in the bar chart because it has been shown that the magnitude channels on ordered attributes ranks positioning on a common scale (bar chart) to be the most effective followed by the position on unaligned scale (stack bar chart) and the angle (pie chart) to be the least effective.
