# The Visualization/Experiment
The experiment uses the following graphs:
  - Bar chart
  - Pie chart
  - Stacked bar chart

Our experiment is hosted live and can be found at: https://ekavtaradze.github.io/03-Experiment/
**Note: Our visualization and error reports require a csv file to be downloaded from the experiment site upon submission. These reports were submitted to us via email.**

# Our hypothesis:
We predict that the ranking of effectiveness in human perception of data will be the most effective in the bar chart, followed by the stacked bar chart and pie chart respectively. Users will be able to more accurately compare two given data structures in the bar chart because it has been shown that the magnitude channels on ordered attributes ranks positioning on a common scale (bar chart) to be the most effective followed by the position on unaligned scale (stack bar chart) and the angle (pie chart) to be the least effective.

# Working on the d3 Visualizations and the Experiment Design
The graphs utilized in this experiment were generated with reference to examples listed on the d3 graph gallery.
