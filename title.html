	  <p>The following is an experiment conducted by Yonatan Weiner, Parker Coady, and Errica Cheng for Project 3 of CS480X.</p>
	  <p>On each page will be a procedurally-generated graph. Your task is to guess the percentage the smaller datapoint is to the larger datapoint. For instance, if you think the smaller marked datapoint is about 25% of the larger one, simply type 25 and submit it.</p>
	  <p>There will be 20 bar graphs, 20 Sankey graphs, and 20 bubble charts.</p>
	  <p>At the end of the experiment, please download the CSV file and send it to one of us.</p>
	  <p>By continuing with this experiment, you agree for your submitted data to be used in this project. No personal identifying information will be collected.</p>
	  <p>To continue, press "Submit Guess".</p>
